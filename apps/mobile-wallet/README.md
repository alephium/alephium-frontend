# Alephium mobile wallet

The official Alephium mobile wallet.

## Development

Start by following the development instructions in the [README](../../README.md) of the monorepo.

Then, start a simulator or a physical device (after connecting with USB and enabling USB debugging):

```shell
pnpm ios
# or
pnpm android
```

If you get an error `SDK location not found.` make sure the `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` env var has the path to the Android SDK. For example, on macOS, you can run the following:

```shell
ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=/Users/<USERNAME>/Library/Android/sdk pnpm android
```

### Adding a new language

1. Set up new language in [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/alephium)
1. Run GitHub action to generate translation JSON file for that language
1. Import generated JSON file in `src/features/localization/i18n.ts` and update `resources`
1. Enable language settings in `src/features/localization/languages.ts`

## EAS build/submit

### Android

#### Internal testing release on Google Play

In most cases, we'll need to build a production version and submitted to Google Play so that we can then decide to release it internally or later on promote the release to a production one through the Google Play Console.

```shell
eas build  --platform android --profile production
eas submit --platform android
```

#### Creating an standalone APK

We will not need this very often, but still useful in some cases.

```shell
eas build --platform android --profile internal
```

### iOS

#### TestFlight

In most cases we want to release a TestFlight version so that we can have an open testing phase.

```shell
eas build --platform ios --profile production
eas submit --platform ios
```

#### Internal release

Only registered iOS devices will get internal releases.

```shell
eas build --platform ios --profile internal
eas submit --platform ios
```

## Releasing

In general, follow the same [instructions as in the desktop wallet](../desktop-wallet/README.md). The only difference is that `pnpm exec changeset version` will only update the version in the `package.json` but the version needs to be updated manually in 3 more places:

- `/app.config.js`
- `/android/app/build.gradle`
- `/ios/Alephium/Info.plist`
